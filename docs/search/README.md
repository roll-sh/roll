# roll search

Elasticsearch-compatible search clusters that cost nothing while idle, wake in milliseconds,
branch instantly and keep their data on object storage. Clients speak the Elasticsearch REST API
(or OpenSearch's): the official clients, searchkick, Laravel Scout and Spring Data work by
changing the URL.

Design: [architecture.md](architecture.md). Cross-crate interfaces: [contracts.md](contracts.md).

## Run it

`rolld` serves search next to the other roll services:

```sh
cargo run -p rolld                      # REST on 127.0.0.1:59200, roll API on 127.0.0.1:7070
pnpm dev                                # dashboard: /dashboard/search
```

| flag (env)                                         | default           | |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | - |
| `--search-http` (`ROLL_SEARCH_HTTP`)               | `127.0.0.1:59200` | Elasticsearch REST listener |
| `--search-tls-cert`, `--search-tls-key`            |                   | serve HTTPS (PEM) |
| `--search-domain` (`ROLL_SEARCH_DOMAIN`)           |                   | clusters at `<name>.<domain>` (SNI / `Host` routing) |
| `--search-idle-unload` (`ROLL_SEARCH_IDLE_UNLOAD`) | `300`             | seconds without requests before a cluster sleeps (default for new clusters) |
| `--search-cache-bytes`                             | 10 GiB            | local disk cache for segments |

| `--search-proxy-protocol`                          | off               | PROXY protocol headers (behind an NLB or HAProxy) |
| `--search-history` (`ROLL_SEARCH_HISTORY`)         | `86400`           | point-in-time branching window, seconds (0: off) |
| `--search-gc-interval`                             | `3600`            | garbage collection of unreferenced objects (0: off; one node per bucket) |
| `--search-test-features`                           | off               | publish Elasticsearch's test features (YAML suites through `--cluster-hook`; test deployments only) |
| `--no-search`                                      |                   | don't run search |
| `--search-only` (`ROLL_SEARCH_ONLY`)               |                   | only search and its API (search nodes on AWS) |

Storage is rolld's: `--s3-bucket` (with `--s3-prefix`, `--s3-endpoint`), or `<home>/objects`.
Local disk under `<home>/search/` holds `search.db` (the control plane's SQLite) and the cache.

## Use it

```sh
roll search clusters create app            # prints the URL, user and password (shown once)
curl -u app:<password> http://127.0.0.1:59200/
roll search request app PUT /products '{"mappings":{"properties":{"title":{"type":"text"}}}}'
roll search request app POST /products/_bulk @products.ndjson
roll search request app GET '/products/_search?q=title:shoes'
roll search clusters branch app app-preview              # instant copy, its own password
roll search clusters branch app app-yesterday --at 1d    # as of a day ago
roll search clusters indices app
roll search clusters usage app                           # cost vs Elastic Cloud / Amazon OpenSearch
roll search clusters password app | unload app | delete app | url app | show app | list
```

A cluster's name is its identity: the Basic auth user, the host label under `--search-domain`,
`cluster_name` in `GET /`. Names are DNS labels (lowercase letters, digits, `-`) and can't
change. Clients authenticate with Basic auth (`<name>:<password>`, or any user at the cluster's
own host), `Authorization: ApiKey base64(<name>:<password>)` or
`Authorization: Bearer <name>_<password>`.

## roll API

`/v1/search` on the rolld API port (`crates/search-control/src/api.rs`). Errors are
`{"error": "..."}` with 400, 404, 409, 413 (a console request over the cluster's body limit) or
500.

| method | path | |
| ------ | ---- | - |
| GET | `/v1/search` | version, endpoint, storage, defaults, pricing, loaded clusters |
| GET | `/v1/search/clusters` | list |
| POST | `/v1/search/clusters` | create `{name, flavor?, parent?, at?, idle_timeout_s?, max_in_flight?, max_body_mb?, destructive_requires_name?}`; answers with `url`, `username`, `password` (once) and `id` — the shape `search-yaml run --cluster-hook` expects |
| GET | `/v1/search/clusters/{id or name}` | settings, `status` (`loaded` with live index count and requests in flight, or `asleep`), last metered `indices`/`docs`/`stored_bytes`, `url`, `branches` |
| PATCH | `/v1/search/clusters/{id}` | `flavor`, `idle_timeout_s` (0: always loaded), `max_in_flight`, `max_body_mb`, `destructive_requires_name`; the idle timeout and body limit apply at once (also to a cluster that is waking up); a new flavor, `destructive_requires_name` or `max_in_flight` needs a reload: the cluster is put to sleep now, or as soon as no request runs (always-on clusters included), and keeps its current ones until then |
| DELETE | `/v1/search/clusters/{id}` | waits for running requests and for a wake in progress (which is locked out and unloaded, never left serving); branches keep working |
| GET, POST | `/v1/search/clusters/{id}/branches` | list; branch `{name, at?}` (`at`: Unix seconds within `--search-history`) |
| POST | `/v1/search/clusters/{id}/password` | rotate; the new password is in the answer, once. From the answer on, the old one fails, also on a cluster that was waking up |
| POST | `/v1/search/clusters/{id}/unload` | sleep now (`{"unloaded": false}` while requests run) |
| GET | `/v1/search/clusters/{id}/indices` | `_cat/indices` as JSON numbers: health, status, shards, docs, sizes; docs and sizes of open indices come from the engine (as `_stats` reports them: Lucene documents, nested ones included, unflushed writes included). Wakes the cluster |
| POST | `/v1/search/clusters/{id}/request` | console: `{method, path, body?}` (a JSON body, sent byte for byte so `_source` keeps its key order, or a string such as NDJSON, sent as is) → `{status, headers, body, took_ms, truncated}`. Accepts bodies up to the cluster's `max_body_mb` (the request may be up to twice that plus 1 MiB, for JSON escapes) |
| GET | `/v1/search/clusters/{id}/usage?days=30` | loaded seconds, GiB-hours, requests, stored GiB-months, cost, and the same workload on Elastic Cloud Hosted, an Amazon OpenSearch Service domain and OpenSearch Serverless |

To run the YAML REST suites against clusters made through the API, start rolld with
`--search-test-features` and point the runner at the create endpoint:
`search-yaml run --cluster-hook http://127.0.0.1:7070/v1/search/clusters --jobs 8 …` (each worker
gets its own cluster, deleted afterwards).

The dashboard (`/dashboard/search/<cluster>`) lists indices; selecting one opens its documents
(paged `_search` with a query string, as rows or as a table of the most common fields), mapping
and settings, with refresh and delete. Documents can be added, edited and deleted in place
(`refresh=wait_for`, routing kept), and any view opens in the Dev Tools console. The console
completes as you type (Ctrl+Space to ask): methods, paths and index names on the first line;
body keys, query and aggregation types, mapping parameters, field types and the index's field
names (from its mapping) in the body, line by line for `_bulk` and `_msearch`. It highlights JSON
and copies a request as curl. The dashboard never re-encodes JSON it sends or shows: console and
document bodies go out as typed (`1.0` stays a float to dynamic mapping, longs above 2^53 stay
exact, key order is kept), `_source` is cut from the response text, and responses are re-indented
token by token (`lib/search-docs.ts`: `formatJson`, `hitSources`, `sourceCells`). Index names and mappings are fetched only when a completion needs
them, so opening the console never wakes a sleeping cluster.

## Metering and pricing

Every 60 s the control plane accounts each loaded cluster's loaded time exactly (load and unload
come from the node's lifecycle hooks; an unload accounts the remainder, rounded up to a second),
its requests (today only the console's: the node doesn't count client requests per cluster
yet) and its resident size, measured from the engine: the heap its shards hold (segments still in
memory, readers' heap and caches, indexing buffers, the version map) plus 16 MiB for the cluster
itself. Size is measured at every tick and as the cluster unloads, and each interval is billed at
the larger of the measurements at its two ends. While a cluster is loaded with every index open,
its document count is the engine's (unflushed writes included); otherwise it comes from the
commit points. Both count Lucene documents (nested ones included), as `_stats` does, so the figure
doesn't jump when the cluster unloads. Stored bytes are re-read from the cluster's commit points after every load and
unload and every 10 minutes while loaded; storage accrues from a change log, so a sleeping
cluster adds no rows. Prices are AWS list prices in `crates/search-control/src/pricing.rs`, each
with its source.

## Tests

```sh
pnpm test:search              # scripts/test-search.sh: skips itself when nothing changed
scripts/test-search.sh --unit # no Docker
```

`scripts/test-search.sh` builds and lints every `search-*` crate, `rolld` and `roll-cli`, runs
their tests (the control plane's integration tests in `crates/search-control/tests` drive the
API, the node and an Elasticsearch client over HTTP; `crates/roll-cli/tests/search.rs` runs the
real `roll` binary against an in-process control plane), the dashboard's console completion and
document helpers (`apps/dashboard/src/lib/search-*.test.mjs`, under `node --test`; Node 23.6+
runs the TypeScript as is), then the YAML REST suites against
`search-dev` for both dialects. A suite passes when its pass count is at least the minimum in
[compatibility.md](compatibility.md), written as

```
<!-- test-search: roll >= 1234 -->
<!-- test-search: roll-os >= 567 -->
```

Raise the minimum whenever the count goes up, so it can't silently go back down. The
differential suite against a real Elasticsearch (`crates/search-server/tests/differential.rs`)
and the client matrix (`tests/search/clients/run.sh`) run when present. CI:
`.github/workflows/search.yml`, triggered from `ci.yml` when search code changes.
